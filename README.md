## Overview

Shiori is a simple bookmarks manager written in Go language. Intended as a simple clone of Pocket. You can use it as command line application or as web application. This application is distributed as a single binary, which means it can be installed and used easily.

### Features

- Simple and clean command line interface.
- Basic bookmarks management i.e. add, edit and delete.
- Search bookmarks by their title, tags, URL and page content.
- Import and export bookmarks from and to Netscape Bookmark file.
